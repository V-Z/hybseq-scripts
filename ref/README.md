# References FASTA formatted for usage in HybPiper should be placed here

See <https://github.com/mossmatters/HybPiper/wiki#12-target-file> for information how the reference (bait) FASTA file should look like.

Script `concat.sh` can serve like inspiration (it will probably require tuning for particular case) how to concatenate exon sequences outputted from assemblers like Geneious which are already renamed according to HybPiper requirements.
