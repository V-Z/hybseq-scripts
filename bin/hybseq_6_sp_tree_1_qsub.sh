# Computes species trees with ASTRAL from all sets of gene trees in the current directory. The input file(s) must be named "*.nwk".
# The tree lists created by hybseq_5_gene_trees_4_postprocess.sh contain on the beginning of each line name of respective genetic region (according to reference bait file). This is advantageous for loading the lists into R, but ASTRAL requires each line to start directly with the NEWICK record. Remove the names by something like:
# sed -i 's/^[[:graph:]]\+ //' *.nwk
